    abstract={The relationship between inequality and social welfare is an important yet understudied one. Using state-level data, we first undertake a critical replication of a study conducted in the Economic Survey in 2021 and find that the claimed positive inequality-welfare correlation does not hold. We then used unsupervised learning methods, namely, principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering to classify states into  groups based on a gamut of welfare indicators. We find the following: one, some clusters form neatly around geographical divisions (north vs south)  and confirm well-established developmental facts. Two, we document significant heterogeneity amongst other regions ( eg. North-East) that do not adhere to established narratives. Three, we find that  the development gap between states is persistent and path-dependent. Finally, we underscore the need to strengthen rights-based legislations and establish a set of universal basic rights to course-correct for persistent inequalities.},
