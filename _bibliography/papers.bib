	abstract = {While the origin of shadow banks may be traced to the 1970s, developing countries have witnessed a massive growth of shadow banks in more recent decades. India too has seen a similar growth in shadow banks; however, the recent 2018 collapse of IL\&FS Group, a major shadow bank, disrupted the credit cycle, stalled investment and even affected overall GDP growth. With experts warning that shadow banks are susceptible to systemic risks and crisis, it becomes imperative to understand the shadow banking system better. In this paper, we use exploratory data analysis,both quantitative and qualitative, to draw attention to the need for definitional clarity in the concept of shadow banks and how they operate. Trends in Indian shadow banking are discussed using data drawn from secondary sources. Systemic risks in India's shadow banking sector are identified and policy interventions are discussed. The study is imperative for highlighting the importance of shadow banking in India, its growth and the evolving policy interventions regulating this important component of the financial system.},

I find that a larger share of debt movement is explained by changes in interest rate, growth and inflation, than by accumulation of new debt, for both national and sub-national debt. Simulations show that a strict perusal of the debt targets will force the government to run surpluses, while relaxing the targets generates fiscal space up to 4\% of the GDP.},

Using data from medium to large cities in the United States from 1960 to 2010, the authors estimate the effect of police on crime. To correct for the presence of measurement error, they propose to combine the information from two proxies of the police variable within the generalized method of moments framework. Throughout our replication exercise, we find that, in general, the original results are robust to computation in R compared to STATA and to the inclusion of more recent data (until 2019).},

	abstract={External balance is a critical constraint in the macroeconomic dynamics of a developing economy. Typically, external adjustment is said to occur through changes in the real exchange rate, and implicitly in the terms of trade. This article decomposes India’s merchandise trade ratio into three parts, namely, change in terms of trade, relative expenditure growth and relative import intensity over the period 1980‒2021. It finds that terms of trade contribute little to the evolution of India’s trade ratio from the 1990s. Instead, falling relative expenditure growth, due to India growing faster than its trade partners and, rising relative import intensity, due to a reduction in India’s reliance on imports relative to its partners, explain a large share of the change in the trade ratio post-1991. Devaluations have not contributed to the improvement in the trade ratio, while export growth and reduced domestic intensity have been critical.},
